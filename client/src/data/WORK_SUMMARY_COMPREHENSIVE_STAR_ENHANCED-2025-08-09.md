## Major Impact Projects

### Firestorm Implementation: Cross-Team Service Architecture and Launch

**Situation:** Prime Video client teams lacked a scalable mechanism for cache invalidation and push-based notifications, resulting in stale content experiences for customers and manual operational overhead for engineering teams. No existing precedent existed within Amazon for a unified push notification service serving multiple Prime Video client applications, creating both technical and coordination challenges across [TK number] dependency teams including ACN, Firebat, and multiple Prime Video client edge services.

**Task:** As one of two initial service owners, I was tasked with co-architecting and implementing Amazon's first unified push notification service for Prime Video. My responsibilities included establishing service architecture, coordinating requirements across multiple stakeholder teams, implementing comprehensive Infrastructure as Code, and leading the complete Operational Readiness Review process while designing an extensible architecture supporting unknown future use cases beyond the initial cache invalidation requirement.

**Action:** I drove technical architecture decisions and implementation across multiple teams by establishing comprehensive Infrastructure as Code using CDK and Kotlin. I implemented Lambda-based business logic and created **innovative** integration patterns with the ACN (Async Client Notification) API that became the foundation for all Prime Video push notifications. I coordinated requirements across [TK number] dependency teams while navigating ambiguous requirements and designing flexible architecture through **ingenuity** and systematic stakeholder engagement. I led the complete Operational Readiness Review process, creating comprehensive metrics frameworks, alarm strategies, and integration testing patterns that became organizational standards. When faced with unclear technical specifications from dependency teams, I **overcame roadblocks** by proactively driving conversations to establish clear requirements and deliverable timelines, ensuring project momentum despite external uncertainties.

### Image Optimization Initiative: Performance and Cost Impact at Scale

**Situation:** Prime Video customers experienced slow page load times and poor performance on lower-end devices due to oversized hero images, some reaching 11MB in size. This particularly impacted mobile experience and international customers with limited bandwidth, affecting [TK million] daily customer interactions. The Marketing team indicated they couldn't modify images at source due to multiple content providers, and existing image processing systems from Borg migration contained inefficient legacy code that frequently caused card drops due to regex mismatches.

**Task:** I was assigned to lead a comprehensive technical investigation to identify root causes of image bloat across the Firebolt system and design a scalable solution that would work across all image types and sources without requiring changes to existing content workflows. My responsibilities included analyzing image size issues across multiple content sources, designing WebP conversion systems, and refactoring legacy image manipulation systems to prevent card drops while improving code maintainability.
